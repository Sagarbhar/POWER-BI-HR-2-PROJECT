### Data Cleaning

1) To combine multiple tables in Power Query of Power BI, use the "Append Queries" feature and select the relevant tables, ensuring they have the same structure. Renaming tables and organizing them in folders can help with navigation.

2) Used the "Change Type" option in Power Query to alter data types for each column.

3) Utilized the "Replace Values" option in Power Query to edit the Department column to have each word capitalized.

4) Used the "Remove Duplicates" option in Power Query to remove duplicate values from the dataset.

5) Created a conditional column using the "Add Conditional Column" option in Power Query and set the condition to display the sales ratio based on the sales column.

6) Created a new query with the salary details and merge it with the main table using the "EMP ID" column as the key.

7) Accessed the "Transform Data" tab in Power Query and choose the "Date. Year" function to extract the Day from a date column.
